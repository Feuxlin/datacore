I often see players say that they chose Ziyal for her MED, but I feel that's a mistake if your other behold choices are average or better. Granted, that MED is #2 among Cardassians (her only event bonus to date), but only because she's one of two Cardassians with any MED, which means that shuttle seats and crafting nodes for future events are likely to be fairly scarce for MED, per usual. She may pop up on a few voyages out of necessity for new players, but the investment will not pay off into the mid-game and beyond. If you select her as a character choice, you'll be hoping for a Cardassian or Bajoran mega, like the several other racial events that have come before.
