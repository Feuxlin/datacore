Hailing from an all-time bad episode of Trek is one way to be remembered. Another is to own some serious in-game power. Ms. Earhart was tucked away in a weekday pack alongside President Lincoln and so may have been overlooked by some, but she's a diamond in the rough. If you owned her for the Pilot mega to close out 2018, congratulations on your enormous advantage over the field. That month is likely to be the peak of her weekend usefulness, but a top two base can't be denied the rest of the time, even if it sits behind a crew that most players have immortalized. Her shuttle potential is obvious, but even more impressive is her reign as the top voyage ENG which is well into month six. #1 overall voyager Braxton may have pipped her for ENG+CMD voyages, but she still has great job security on any roster. To ensure that, and help make up for any event deficiencies, Earhart snags two spots in the gauntlet rankings, including a DIP/ENG pair capable of 2-for-1ing The Caretaker.
