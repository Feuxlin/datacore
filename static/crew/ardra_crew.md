Poor-ish stats with little staying power. Excels in a single area, but is fantastic there; arena +Acc @ 6 sec with huge crit values. If you want her arena prowess only, then ignore this ranking as she's one of the best there. For some, she may find a recurring niche as Skirmish crew, where she can provide a ludicrous boost for any level of instant damage crew you care to field.
