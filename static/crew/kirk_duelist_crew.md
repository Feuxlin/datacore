With Kal-if-fee and Mirror Kirks dueling for the honor of 'worst variant for cost', you want to steer clear of both if possible. Kirk is guaranteed events until the end of Timelines and Kal-if-fee's SEC sits behind only the popular Rura Penthe among variants - that's about where his usefulness ends. There's theoretical value in his +1 Inspiring and more realistically in a top 25 proficiency total, but his rolls are spread too evenly to be effective. His best case behold scenario is against two redundant or useless options.
