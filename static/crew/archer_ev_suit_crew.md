After being one of the last holdouts for an event feature, the second half of 2018 suddenly brought Archer a double feature, a mega, and one more bonus for good measure. Great news for players looking to utilize EV Suit's strong CMD base. A similarly ranked voyage CMD with useful tertiary ENG will grant him voyage opportunities beyond those suggested by a subpar voyage total. Jury Rigger is still a valuable commodity and with Archer's event count finally growing to match his base, he's becoming a more tempting investment for those looking to complete the difficult collection.
