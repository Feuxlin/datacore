2018 delivered our yearly Wesley event in the 11th hour. For all those who lamented airlocking or passing on a Wesley because he happened to catch an event, stop it. You still made the right choice. And passing on the Lieutenant is the right choice more often than not. He offers (very) thin value on shuttles, weekends, and in the gauntlet. He has some usable arena EV, but surprisingly voyages are where he's most effective, despite a sub-100 stat ranking. Only a handful of crew ranked higher share his skill set and only Mirror Data shares his order. If you want to get an A, then take Wes for his voyage work and consider anything else you get out of him as a bonus.
