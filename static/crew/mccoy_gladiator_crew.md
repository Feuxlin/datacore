From 'Bread and Circuses' comes an old man with a sword as one of the most deadly beings in the known universe. His SEC is obviously tops for a MED focused character and may be so for a long time. An uncommon skill pairing translates to usefulness elsewhere including usable gauntlet numbers and the #2 MED+SEC total for voyages. Once fused, he's likely to make voyage runs for you far past the 8 hour mark a la Mirror Phlox. Gladiator is capable of contributing an impressive amount for a 2-skill crew whose name rarely generates buzz.
