Most of us loathe the thought of collecting another DIP/CMD 2-skiller, but Uhura's dual 1k bases are good enough for daily use starting at 3/5 and she's picked up a half dozen events including two features. With no DIP crew in the top 30 able to match her CMD base, she may be worth consideration as a 2-for-1 that will allow you to freeze an extra CMD crew and free up a slot.
