A fairly well-rounded 2-skiller. His proficiency pair is #1 in the gauntlet and he has two usable bases for event work. Non-Jury Rigger collections generally aren't a consideration for legendary crew, but finding three in one package is still a nice perk. An uncommon voyage skill combo and power sitting next to the worst 3-skill crew makes him at least an option there. Missing a third skill is the only thing keeping O'Brien from vaulting up the ranks.
