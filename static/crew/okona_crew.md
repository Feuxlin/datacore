Much like his dreamboat on-screen character, The Outrageous Okona gives us just what we want for non-event crew. Forget bases that'll never catch an event bonus. Okona uses his proficiencies, including the #1 DIP/ENG gauntlet pair, to deliver great voyage numbers; the highest for his skill set. His voyage prowess makes him one of the better options to immortalize en route to finishing the Jury Rigger collection which still requires a few legendary crew to complete.
