Mirror MED monster. Great at 1/4 for gauntlet and 4/4 for voyages and shuttles. Ridiculous voyage MED lead over the pack with an underrepresented stack earns him a MED/SEC voyage seat past 9 hours. #1 gauntlet MED roll. Only 2-skiller in the top 35 proficiency totals (and he's 4th!). Three ranked gauntlet pairs among all crew including the #1 MED/SEC. Whopping FIVE different previous traits have been event bonus and he's been featured event crew twice. #3 base MED. Even one of the very few instant damage arena crew to fit the MED slot. Undeniably great in every facet of the game and my choice for best Super Rare.
