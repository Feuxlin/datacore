It's absolutely incredible that this two year old card is still as effective as he is. Let's start at the collections tab, where he's nearly peerless. An early 2019 server push pushed Locutus into rarefied air as one of three crew to appear in three stat-boosting collections, none of which are particularly easy to complete. The raw voyage numbers are great, and while a DIP/SEC set may not seem impressive, by the time you're reading this he'll likely be one of only two such crew in the top 50, barring additions. His wheelhouse remains the gauntlet where only he and The Caretaker own two #1 ranked skill pairings (four overall). A massive DIP proficiency is the best single roll in the game and often boosted by a half dozen frequently seen crit traits. His unique arena ability (1 second attack) can allow some skirmish shenanigans with fast-activating damage crew and shave a lot of time off your weekends.

The elephant in the room is clearly a set of poor bases. Though not at Gowron levels of disgusting, they're bad enough to be considered a solid super rare, even at 5/5. His opportunities are fairly frequent thanks to Picard and Borg weekends (#2 Borg DIP), but he'll perform noticeably behind the top ranked crew and even some 4/4s. When you consider the total package, which Locutus is, it wouldn't be right to put him anywhere but alongside tier 1 luminaries.
