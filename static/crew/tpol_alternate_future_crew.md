Despite relatively few traits, AF T'Pol has climbed to double digit events and owns the #1 CMD base for both her variants and the Vulcanians. In addition, she's on the short list of the best CMD+SCI voyagers. Despite her only other fringe offering being a middling gauntlet pair, AF T'Pol has enough power behind her stats to be a regular fixture on any roster.
