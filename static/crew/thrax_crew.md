Poised to bring in the new meh-ga with a whimper, Thrax has exceeded all expectations...in the opposite direction. With desolate future event chances and the worst possible skill set, players were hoping Thrax would lower the boom with his stats. It didn’t happen. His bases are roughly similar to previous megas Kortar and Kol of House Kor (worse primary, better secondary), which is to say easily replaceable and several months behind the times. With every SEC crew above his base offering better power or utility, it would seem that the best case scenario for Thrax in the future would be a Cardassian mega event.

That’s the good news. His voyage potential is abysmal and between an ordinary skill set and pedestrian numbers seated between Judge Q and Revolutionary Damar (one million Quatloos if you’ve ever seen either of them recommended for voyages), he may never even make a run on established rosters. The cherry on this turd sandwich is increased boarding damage in the arena.

So, citations. Despite what this card offers in a vacuum compared to the field of hundreds of others, he will no doubt find work early on for many rosters. That’s the power of stars. And although it’s tempting to finish a crew that you actively use, he will age poorly and offers the thinnest of value over the crew he replaces because of how common his offerings are. Spending honor is an investment that you want to stretch to its fullest and this crew would do the opposite for you.
