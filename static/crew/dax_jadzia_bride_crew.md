It's not often I go out of my way to compliment a Dax, but Bride is much more useful than her numbers look. She's already picked up two megas to go with Dax's hefty event count which trumps base ranks when she's getting so much use out of them. Her proficiencies result in only a single ranked pair, but with so many traits, she performs like Guinan-lite as a DIP primary.
DIP/SCI isn't necessarily hurting for voyage options, but of those ranked higher only one of them is main cast (Mambo Picard) and it would take all of them combined to match her number of variant events - something to think about if you're in the market for more flexible crew. If you're only after big base or voyage numbers that's understandable, but Bride's versatility warrants consideration, even if she doesn't offer anything elite day to day.
