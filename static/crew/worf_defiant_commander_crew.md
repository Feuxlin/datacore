Gross stats, though very new players might get a win out of him in the gauntlet. Worf/Klingon events are frequent enough, but his bases won't win you any weeks. Great crit values in the arena, but between a slower activation time and evasion handicap, there are better options available. An equip list that's light on Klingon/KCA faction items.
