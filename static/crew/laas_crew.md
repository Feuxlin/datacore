His strong voyage numbers are most notable even if it's not the best early game skill set. His SCI base used to be a better option, but in the face of many stronger Disco options may struggle to find a seat. A "use" crew if you can star him up early, but slim long term benefits since he doesn't get a cut of the Dominion pie.
