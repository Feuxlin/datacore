Providing the all important +1 Cockatoo to your roster, the good Lady Beverly has amazing art, but mediocre events (3) without Crusher's usual Physician to soften the blow. Hologram may net you some more, though the trait's best days are behind it. MED scarcity means you might hold on to her for longer than similarly stock crew, but she's just not that good.
