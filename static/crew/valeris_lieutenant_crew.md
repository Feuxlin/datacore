Abysmal bases, so those Vulcan events don't matter as much as her three event features - all of which were a Galaxy (10x bonus). Her main daily contribution will come in the gauntlet where she has the #1 cumulative proficiency total and the best CMD/SCI and SEC/SCI pair among 4* crew. Strong +9 Acc at four seconds in the arena is worth a look.
