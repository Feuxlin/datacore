Perhaps the least well known of Jeffrey Combs' many faces, this scoundrel has the worst event chances (1 Brutal), but respectable overall utilIty. Between a 200% instant damage attack and a base #7 ENG, he certainly has the stats to justify daily use, though older rosters may find themselves freezing him sooner rather than later. If he's lucky, one of his fanny-pack's worth of traits will end up being the next surprise mega theme. Otherwise - that's Tsunkatse, baby.
