The Hologram mega has made several old crew notes of mine look foolish and now have me wildly speculating about potential future trait events that may bring crew into relevance. A villain mega may make The Professor a fearsome shuttle DIP, or perhaps he never snags another event bonus. Regardless, his voyage power/skill set combo remains strong enough to merit consideration in a behold against poor cards or luxury event 2-skillers.
