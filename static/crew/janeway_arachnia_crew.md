Another crew who had a terrible 2018. DB continues to churn out stronger DIP options, as expected, but on top of that, Janeway's event count suddenly halted. With her voyage numbers dead last among all CMD/DIP/SEC legendaries, that sort of bonus dry spell tanks her desirability as a card. A vanity collection spot and workable arena numbers are a consideration, as is a glimmer of event hope in the form of an early 2019 event feature, but her daily use is too poor to justify taking her for an event count which may rise, but likely not return to its previously stellar rate.
