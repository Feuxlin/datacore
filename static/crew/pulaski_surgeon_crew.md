I'm notoriously tough on non-event 2-skillers which you know Pulaski is when freakin' Chakotay doubles her features. But her MED lead over the former mega Bashir is significant and her total numbers are good enough for some voyage work in a depleted MED/SCI stack. Top MED and SCI/MED crew have some serious potential for Faction events - even if Pulaski rarely catches a bonus, she can contribute where it counts.

A recent variant has bettered both of Surgeon's bases while bringing more voyage power to the table. With Pulaski event chances being as thin as they are, Surgeon has lost a lot of her lustre for possible future events.
