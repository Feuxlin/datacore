I'm notoriously tough on non-event 2-skillers which you know Pulaski is when freakin' Chakotay quadruples her featured events.  But her MED lead is Culber-esqe over the next option and her total numbers are good enough for some voyage work in a depleted MED/SCI stack. MED seats are the least common seats for Faction events, but her base strength is hard to deny and still has daily value.
