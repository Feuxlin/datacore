His gumbo sure is smellin' good, but it's the rest of this card that stinks. Poor Grandpa Joe doesn't collect event appearances from his son or grandson and is among the worst voyagers in the game. Even a respectable DIP proficiency gets stomped by the likes of Surak and Locutus in his only ranked gauntlet pair. Leave this card to the collectors.
