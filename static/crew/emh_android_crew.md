Trekkies who adore good ol' Doc now have a proper vessel to channel their love into. The ignorant Kyrians unwittingly gave us a couple more event chances to play with thanks to Android and several other villainous traits. The EMA promises to make good use of them with not only the #3 MED base, but a SECondary that's 622 points better than the next Doc option. As potent as that all sounds, his voyage work is even better and may rival ENG/MED as the combo that nobody talks about.

There are a grand total of three legendary voyagers with MED and SEC as their top two skills and EMA easily outpaces them. He's not just the best option for that combo, he's also the #1 voyage MED for 3-skill crew, the #3 MED+CMD total, and is guaranteed a seat for a long, long time until at least two handfuls of crew are added above his power level. If you were happy with Katrina Cornwell, you'll fall in love with [Doctor Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK8mneO8yvU).
