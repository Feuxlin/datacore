A name that doesn't get mentioned enough. Very versatile and effective crew between his stout voyage numbers (#1 ENG+DIP total), double collections, and Klingon + O'Brien events. Even worth a look in the arena where short initialization +Acc/shield repair and strong passive numbers can be situationally useful. Docked a point for a fairly expensive equip cost, but his immortalized value is worth it.
