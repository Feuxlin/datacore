Everywhere you look at Kim's stats, they seem miserably underpowered. It's likely that his ENG sandwiched by some CMD/DIP/SEC crew will seem appealing on the behold screen, but his stats don't really support daily use past the early game. Being the only legendary variant of Kim helps a lot for his twice-a-year events, but that's about all you're getting from him. If you're after the Janeway in his non-vanity vanity collection, you're probably better off spending honor to finish her and skipping both Kim and Odo while immortalizing the other fine crew in that group.
