One of the better non-event values in the portal. Double collections including the super tough Jury Rigger and top 50 voyage numbers where above him only Tactical Burnham and Mirror Mayweather share his skill set. You don't want to pass on 1-4* Jury Riggers too often and his voyage prowess will also serve you nicely into the mid-game.
