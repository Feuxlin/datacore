Events are her main path to relevance and after a long drought, they've experienced a rebound at the start of 2019. While this particular variant is as boring as dollar store vanilla ice cream, she's still a warm and able body for Factions. Narrow window as quick +Acc arena crew would seemingly be her only other use - but wait! There's more! Just like Tuvix, the Duras Sisters and the Bynars, this particular Janeway can now be fused with Mutated Paris to form Evolved Janeway, an above average legendary with superlative DIP/SCI and a place in every Voyager fan's heart. Don't be so quick to airlock her when you see her anymore - each copy is one step closer to that great big salamander in the sky.
Captain Janeway/Mutated Paris - March 19
By their powers combined, these two form a pretty good crew. Mutated Paris already had some potential with his good Faction DIP, but now both have a unique new offering; immortal behold immunity. If you have the crew space to spare, target these two - perhaps even over some marginally better super rare crew. The payoff Evolved Janeway is much preferable to 1,000 honor.
