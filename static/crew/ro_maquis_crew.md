Just above average base and voyage numbers, but the combination of her skill set and lack of events, collections, or any top tier offering means you would ideally like to have 2-3 copies fall into your lap in short order before taking her from a behold. Let her float in via voyage rewards before you spend a behold to freeze her to satisfy the collector in all of us.
