Scotty's elite ENG base certainly seems out of place among his peers in this column, but it's one of the only things he has going for him. Former mega Ru'afo dwarfs him by nearly 100 points for non-bonus shuttle work, which is all Scotty can claim these days. A single event in three years of STT is baffling to say the least and to make matters worse, his lone event (and feature) was during a mega event, of which none have been re-run to this point. Jury Rigger is another sterling attribute, but his usability doesn't warrant the investment in many cases. His value is higher than this ranking if you missed on Ru'afo, but even then he won't match that ubiquitous powerhouse in Faction events.
