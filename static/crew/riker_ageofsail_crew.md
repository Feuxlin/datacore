I'll just put this here. The beard, the lean, the grin. No one can resist the Riker charm and he certainly deserves more events. As for the card; formerly top shelf voyage stats are beginning to sag, but remain good enough for daily voyage work with the odd weekend chip-in with his #1 variant CMD. Someone pm me on the day in 2019 when I need to edit in his Age of Sail collection.
