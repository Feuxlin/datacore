I won't pretend to prognosticate event futures for Disco crew (except Burnham), but the odds are good that they won't be forgotten. If you're a Disco fan or simply enjoy looking at Jason Isaacs, Captain Lorca's shuttle prowess is tailor-made for you. Two 1k bases for common shuttle skills combine to make a crew who pre-Sato I called the best shuttle crew in the game. Regardless of whether or not the Disco spigot is turned off, he's still get to catch event bonuses often enough to highlight his great numbers including the #1 Mirror CMD. Worth noting, if not utilizing, is his #2 voyage CMD. He's not one of the few 2-skillers I would advocate using for voyages, but if you took him to max for event purposes, he may well be usable for certain voyage combos.
