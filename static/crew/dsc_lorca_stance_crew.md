I won't pretend to prognosticate event futures for Discovery crew (except Burnham), but the odds are good that they won't be forgotten. If you're a Disco fan or simply enjoy looking at Jason Isaacs, Captain Lorca's shuttle prowess is tailor-made for you. Two 1k bases for common shuttle skills combine to make a crew who at release may well have been the best shuttler in the game. Regardless of whether or not the Disco spigot is turned off, he's still set to catch event bonuses often enough to highlight great numbers including the #1 Mirror CMD. Worth noting, if not utilizing, is his #2 voyage CMD. He's not one of the few 2-skillers I would advocate using for voyages, but if you took him to max for event purposes, he may well be usable for certain voyage combos.

Lorca debuted as the #2 Discovery CMD and though he's still useful there, the CMD ranks now have six Discovery crew in the top twenty, the most of any skill. The other five crew all have more utility than Lorca to boot. He's still elite for shuttles; daily and Disco, but it's not as hard anymore to find a crew who can approximate his event splash while being more useful the rest of the time.
