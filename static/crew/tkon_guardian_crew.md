Portal 63 teaches us a valuable lesson; if a crew debuts with mediocre stats, they ain't going to get better. Less than a year from his release, Portal is mired in a poor set of stat rankings and quickly sinking lower. His three traits severely limit any chance to snag a stray event bonus and almost any new crew will perform better on your roster. A 4 second arena activator is mildly interesting, but his poor passive stats somewhat undercut the crit bonus from his ability and can be found elsewhere in a more substantial amount. A useful DIP/ENG stack kept his voyage ability afloat for a while, but it's no longer the rarity that it once was.
