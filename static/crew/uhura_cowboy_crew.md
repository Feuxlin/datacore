You can certainly do worse for CMD/DIP/SEC crew, but although the raw numbers aren't terribly disappointing right now, they'll only drop lower by the time you fuse her up. That's not normally a concern for a crew who can offer value elsewhere, but it's just not the case for Uhura. The circumstances of her arena ability (12 sec/position/3 sec duration) are almost too much hassle just to snag some instant damage, but if you're a new player with few options, it may still help you out. Uhura's event spacing has actually been fairly consistent, but consistently infrequent. If you select her, it will be for her daily work with a twice-a-year bump for events or as a collector for two exclusive vanity collection spots.
