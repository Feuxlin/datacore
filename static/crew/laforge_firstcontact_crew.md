Unfortunately the most notable thing about this Geordi is a dead last voyage total among 3-skill crew. Offering nearly 600 points lower than the #40 crew is a significant chunk of stats and means that despite a nice skill set, you shouldn't be choosing him with the expectation of significantly bolstering your voyages. But he can still perform for events with a few stars under his belt. A variant-best SCI and workable ENG gives him event consideration a few times per year.
