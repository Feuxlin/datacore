It has been a long time since Bashir's variants have had a standalone event, but as part of two previous megas and with a slew of traits, he still has chances to make an impact. A good deal of his value is in the absurd lead he has over other Bashirs for both his bases. When it comes time for SEC/ENG event work, it's a case of the haves and the have nots. He's the type of crew along with names like Survivalist Kirk or Solar Sisko that you'd like to snag if you're looking to corner the market on a character's event work.  As a small bonus, his gauntlet pair sits at 90% of the power of #1 if you want to use him when his traits align.
