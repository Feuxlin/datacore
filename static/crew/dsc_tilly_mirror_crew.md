Killy rules the ship battles with an iron fist and is similar to gauntleteers in that if you have a chance to grab her first star, you do it. If you don't have her yet, she's tier 1 for me. Pair her with some fast activating crit crew like Ardra/Karr/Scott and rake in the rewards from six second ship battles. She will literally save you hours of gameplay over the course of countless arena dailies and skirmishes and unlike the aforementioned gauntlet counterparts, she benefits nicely from extra stars (you'll want to get her to +9/10 attack for those one shots or spend another seat for an attack crew). Although Burnham's ubiquity may damper Killy's CMD power in an all-Disco mega, she's likely to receive plenty of events on her own and is a competent voyager.
