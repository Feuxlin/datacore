If you're here, it's either because you're wondering if Lucy is worth immortalizing all those collection crew or your Elusive Treasures behold made you go "huh, I didn't know I could get this crew from beholds". First, the crew. Janeway events have fallen off a cliff and come flying out the other side of the earth. But now in the 14th month of her drought, we've finally struck oil. If her events pick back up at any sort of respectable clip, her #1 DIP will be an asset and a couple eventable traits (Where is Caretaker?!) may add some surprise value. With #100 being the new average on voyages, Lucy is at least competent there, if unspectacular.


Is she worth the collection effort? If your focus is performance, then no. Odo and Kim are rarely crew you want to take a star of in any circumstance, let alone being worth citations. The other four crew are solid-to-great and so if you're sitting with a 3/5 Lucy and she pops in an elusive treasure pack, then she may save you a huge chunk of honor if you desire her.
