I often make the claim that CMD/DIP/SEC crew don't age gracefully, but the Universal Fizzbin Champion is almost two years old now and proving me wrong. He's still a great base option and above average CMD/DIP/SEC voyager with double-digit events. He may not be as versatile as some and his skill set often needs an extra star to beat out its peers due to higher competition, but if you invest in him, he pays it off without a doubt.
