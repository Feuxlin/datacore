His #2 overall CMD proficiency roll, rivaled by only Kahless, gives him ranked pair power even against legendary crew. It also helps make him a top voyage option. Though that doesn't leave much meat on the bone for bases, he's had a half dozen events thus far and is +1 for one of the trickier collections.
