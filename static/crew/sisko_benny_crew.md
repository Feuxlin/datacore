Benny's #1 variant SCI and DIP bases combined with a healthy event count comprise the bulk of his value. Unlike certain rare skill combos, a SCI/DIP voyage total is a fairly accurate one where you're likely to have some capable options, especially if you were around for Surak. Speaking of which, Surak dominates Benny's one ranked pair in the gauntlet as well. All we can hope for there is for Armus to beat up on Surak's CMD/SCI matchup enough that we see fewer Suraks in the gauntlet (unlikely). As they say, 'black don't crack' and after two and a half years, Benny is still capable of helping you win weekends, even if he lacks pop elsewhere.
