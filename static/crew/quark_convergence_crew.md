2018 was the summer of Quark, granting him six events in a calendar year. He's merely a good 4/4 crew until FF, but a burgeoning event count has provided value. Although Quark doesn't own a top 15 gauntlet pair, he shows up with 65% crit on occasion which can make even average gauntleteers relevant.
