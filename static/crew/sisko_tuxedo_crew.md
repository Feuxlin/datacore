Somewhere there's a horn section blasting a jazzy reprise of Trek music. DS9 is old enough now that we can look back at this heap of campy schmaltz with fondness... After several other skills had received significant jumps in base power, I had been crying caution when former SEC leader Falcon's name came up. A changing of the guard did happen (what a prophet!), but in the gentlest way possible.
Falcon 2.0 owns the big bazooka now with refreshed voyage power and consistent event work thus far. Unlike other top base ENG or MED crew, there are very few reasons for me to knock Roller's High SEC which is one of the most common shuttle seats. He has the requisite bonus count to provide monster weekends and will pick up non-bonus work the rest of the time. Trepidation about Roller's common skill set is understandable, but he's a legitimate citation target as one of the more powerful crew in the game.
