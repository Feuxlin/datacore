Granted, ENG/MED crew are the ring to my Gollum. Still, the skill set is undeniably valuable. The Hologram trait is akin to Vulcan/Klingon in event frequency and his daily use value is off the charts. He's irreplaceable for a few different voyage combos and has two shuttle-worthy bases. When you immortalize him (and you will immortalize him), he hits on two stat-boosting collections.
