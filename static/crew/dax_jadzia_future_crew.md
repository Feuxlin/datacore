I talked recently about how valuable Jadzia is and AF Dax might be the best of the bunch. The #1 SCI and ENG bases for such a popular character is event-winning value and her #1 overall SCI will garner non-bonus event work every so often as well. Her lead in that skill may not be massive, but she's had more event weeks than the next five crew behind her combined. Asking for more out of this card should be considered a bonus, but she's fairly usable elsewhere as well. Stout arena EV comes online fast enough to handle a lot of damage crew and although her voyage rank is ready to tick over into triple digits, it's only about 100 points out of the top 40. Some Jadzias have a better reputation than they deserve, but it's because of elite crew like AF Dax who will more than pull her weight on your crew.
