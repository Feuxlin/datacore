Long lambasted by players for milquetoast stats and being ugly as sin, I find him to be at least competent amongst a sea of a hundred crappy legendaries. The circumstances of his voyage ability are nothing to get excited about, but with the bell curve of stat totals, he's only percentage points behind top 1/3rd crew and really won't perform as poorly as the ranks would suggest. More likely to be of use are the occasional Faction event bonus and double collections. This one-eyed monster is far from elite, but not bottom-barrel in any respect.
