With an event count stuck in the mud (but likely to rebound) and poor bases beside, "Admiral Jane" has two life lines; an uncommon skill set and a unique arena ability. Voyage total is rarely worrisome for SEC/SCI crew. Even if the Admiral may require an extra star to match newer options, she faces very little competition for that voyage combo. But her best attribute is in the arena where formidable passive stats and EV comes online at one second; early enough to help protect you from anything that your opponent can throw at you.
