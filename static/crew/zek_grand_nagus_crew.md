Princess Bride joke. Three event features is as good as it gets for legendary crew, even if you'd just be using Zek to star up a poor card. If/when a Ferengi mega arrives, the Nagus would own the #3 DIP for an entire month. Princess Bride joke. A shuttle pilot starting at 4/5 is the extent of his daily use and with far better DIP options out there, Zek is more like a "break glass in case of Ferengi mega" investment.
