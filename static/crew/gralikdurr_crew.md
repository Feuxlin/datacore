A bit more complex than meets the eye. A non-event 2-skiller (eww), but two collections, a usable SCI base, and a wonky blend of arena stats - Good +EV/shield regen with strong passive stats. His activation will have to be staggered with burst damage so his ability's -2 attack handicap doesn't come into play.
