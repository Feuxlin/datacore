Look, sweetheart, you're gunna want this fella. Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow. But soon...and for the rest of your life. Only a few crew can unlock a particular SEC/Investigator node and one of the more popular options, Detective Data, is very expensive to equip. Sadly, that covers the bulk of his usefulness. He's recently found a home in a vanity collection, but his voyage numbers and skill set are not helpful, nor is what he brings to the gauntlet and arena. While his event count is a nice perk, there are so many Picard versions floating around that his primary, SEC, comes in 7th among variants.
