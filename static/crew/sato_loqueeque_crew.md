With Professor Sato's much heralded arrival and domination of the DIP scene, so died the vast majority of Loque'eque's appeal. Sato's events (3) aren't frequent enough to carry any cards to value on their own and Loque'eque's DIP is not quite high enough to be special. She'll still perform fine for that once a year event, but she's little more than a bit player.
