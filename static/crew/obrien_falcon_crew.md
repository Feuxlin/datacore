His character may be reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons, but Falcon is all business. His SEC base is already legendary, but he's spent so much time at the top that it's only natural for power creep to star catching up. Are we going to see a Professor Sato-like dumpstering of O'Brien in the future? The answer has already begun with a Sisko variant recently besting him, but only by a few points. With 2018 bringing several SEC voyagers to usurp his previous dominance there and only a single O'Brien event, his #2 base ranking is essential to his value. With any luck, his fall from grace will continue to be a gentle tumble, but for now he's got one of the biggest guns in town.
