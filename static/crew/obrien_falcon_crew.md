His character may be reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons, but Falcon is all business. His SEC base is already legendary, but he had spent so much time at the top that it's only natural for power creep to start catching up. Are we going to see a Professor Sato-like dumpstering of O'Brien in the future? The answer was kind to Daumer as new #1 Sisko betters him by only a few points. With 2018 bringing several SEC voyagers to usurp his previous dominance there and only a single O'Brien event, his #2 base ranking is essential to his value. With any luck, his fall from grace will continue to be a gentle tumble, but for now he's got one of the biggest guns in town.
