The back half of 2018 added some options to Rom's previously scarce skill set. With horrific numbers in every corner of this card (including a 10-26 CMD proficiency), the Nagus has to hang his hat on an uncommon skill set and Rom/Ferengi events for relevance. His ENG base is #2 among Ferengi, but with his 4/4 version besting him until FF, it's more often theoretical value for a crew who rarely deserves additional stars.
