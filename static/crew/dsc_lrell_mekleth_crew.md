Traits (including Disco) have pushed L'Rell well into double digit bonuses within a relatively short time which has given two 1k bases several chances to shine. But like a very similar crew, Torchbearer Rejac, it's difficult to count on future value based on trait bonuses that may vanish as the crew pool grows. I'm loathe to speculate on this sort of thing, but considering DB's Disco love affair, there's a good chance that her two usable bases will continue to find work in the (near) future.
