"The worst variant" (cadets notwithstanding) would be an insult to most characters, but not Burnham. This version still manages to pick up a collection and post top 50 voyage numbers alongside fistfuls of Burnham and Disco events to make even average bases useful. Usable +Attack in arena is a consideration for some players.
