A variant-best base for a character with Picard's infinity versions is impressive. And we always welcome a racial trait tacked onto bridge crew to inflate their event count. In the gauntlet, his proficiencies put him within half a percent of the #3 SEC/DIP pair and some durable arena EV activates fast enough to avoid most instant damage crew. His skill set doesn't do much to dampen an otherwise strong crew.
