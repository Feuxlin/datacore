Going off those stat ranks, he would look to fit in a tier or two higher, but his use is sadly a bit too narrow for that. He's a zero in the gauntlet, arena, and events where he averages one per year. It's fantastic and rare to have two such strong bases, yet they're low enough that someone playing any length of time is likely to have a crew ranked higher (Mega 5*) to handle non-bonus faction event work.

Still, they're far from useless and he's in the mix among the best voyagers for a crowded SCI/ENG skill combo. If you're not a fan of DB's Wimpy ranked reward structure and care more about bases than event counts, he's a legitimate citation contender with a stat-boosting collection payoff at the end.
