Despite variant-best CMD and SCI bases, snagging only one event per year won't help Officer Finger Guns waporize too many of your opponents. His calling card had previously been an uncommon CMD/SCI voyage stack, but with several such crew being introduced over the last half year, you may find it easier than before to find an upgrade to him. His power is waning, but Cheekoof still has a chance to earn voyage seating while pitching in for the rare event.
