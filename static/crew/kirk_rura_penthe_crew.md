His stats and collection are both inspiring. Double digit events to pair with a top SEC base that's elite (no, seriously, it's 1337). His 90% Faction rate means that when his event number is called, he will contribute almost without exception. With huge voyage SEC and a stat total ahead of a couple 3-skill crew, he has a chance to catch a ride, depending on your situation. But the key to his value is in the arena. A skirmish anchor who can cut your battles down to six seconds with the right complimentary crew is invaluable. 500% is the highest that instant damage gets and most other damage crew are +Attack or Evasion. His first star is important to grab for his ship ability and can save you hours of gameplay over time.
