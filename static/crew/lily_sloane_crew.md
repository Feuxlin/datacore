The fact that she has "variants" now predisposes her to the possibility of future events, but they will be few and far between. And although her voyage numbers don't look great on the whole, ENG primary/DIP secondary can be difficult to find so she may sneak into the rotation there in the early game. #1 ENG/DIP gauntleteer among 4* crew and a very valuable spot in the Jury Rigger collection.
