No one is particularly excited to see Changeling Martok, which is totally understandable. The only daily use stat that might pique anyone's interest is a top five gauntlet pair that's competitive against everyone not named Locutus or Gowron. But on the weekend he's collected a formidable number of bonuses which should at least merit behold consideration against the plethora of one-hit wonders floating around. With mediocre day to day work, consider him a cryo/event hero who will likely hog a crew spot for quite a while.
