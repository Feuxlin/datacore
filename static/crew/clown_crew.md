Debate the vedek. Always, always choose to debate the vedek. Why? Because he's your best shot at landing one of the few truly good crew that come only from voyages. Sporting a top 10 base SEC, even now, a year and a half on, the Clown brings a meaty secondary ENG and a smattering of traits just brimming with potential (Villain mega?) to bear, handing you a top 25 voyager. He may squarely be daily use crew, but what a wonderful daily use crew.
