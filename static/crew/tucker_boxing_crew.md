Fake Tucker or Fucker Fake Tucker, as I like to call him, was born with a disappointing voyage total that's only gotten lower. But beyond that all-encompassing number sits the #3 ENG+SEC total among 3-skill crew. In certain configurations, he will outperform that ranking. And his outlook is even rosier elsewhere. Two interesting collections in which legendary crew still matter and a great ENG base, even if he's only had a half dozen event opportunities to this point. Not elite in any area, but a name that will come up from time to time.
