Purely a voyager, but with a long window of relevance, despite what the voyage total says. Few crew in the game have ENG + MED together and her accompanying DIP gives her a totally unique skill set among super rares. She'll have no trouble manning voyages for you past 8 hours. The Jury Rigger collection still requires several legendary crew to complete and so is more than just a throw in perk for super rares.
