It's a fool's errand to guess future events (Pilot mega, really?), but you can't tell me Meme Picard wouldn't look great as the poster boy for a February "Romantic" mega. In the here and now, Smitten is fine event crew with two shuttle-quality bases and an event count we can work with. His top five voyage DIP is notable, but unlikely to be used by most players. +1 Inspiring, however, has more value and may be a behold tie-breaker as his star count rises. For a bit of added daily value, consider his arena damage at an ultra-rare nine seconds; slower than some, but fast enough to catch crew like T'kuvma sleeping.
