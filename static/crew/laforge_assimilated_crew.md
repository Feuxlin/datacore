One of his Borg implants must contain a swiss army knife. Heâ€™s no longer the best of the best at anything, but still strong in many areas. A competent base/event pairing with great voyage credentials and a strong ENG/CMD pair in the gauntlet where he hits 65% crit often enough. Double stat-boosting collections are the cherry on top. Resisting him in a behold would be futile.

### Spotlight
Hey girl, are you the saucer section of the USS Enterprise? Cause you are so well-rounded. Note to self: work on a better tagline for this guy.

**Pros:** Great in every area of the game.

**Cons:** [He's not REAL!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfWMBxuA_Jw)

Base, voyages, events, gauntlet, collections; he does it all. Even a +10 EV stat in arena is second only to four crew, all of whom require position to activate their EV ability. His only blemish, the one that keeps him out of top-tier status, is the lack of an elite base. The addition and availability of Ru'afo does him no favors either. But that's nit picky for a crew who still has a top 15 base.

Let's talk copies. I won't attempt to change anyone's mind about citing that last star on a crew in the portal. Or even outright recommend doing so for this handsome fella. But he is one of the most immortal-proof crew in the game. The areas in which a second copy contributes the most (voyages, faction events, gauntlet) are the areas where La Borg crushes it.
