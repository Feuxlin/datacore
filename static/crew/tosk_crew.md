Bad card. ENG is among the least common shuttle skills and there are already two mega crew with better base ENG to fill those non-bonus faction seats. A zero for voyages/gauntlet and his arena EV activates after almost all instant damage crew have blown you to bits. His moment in the sun came before he was even born.
