His ENG base is among the least common shuttle skills and there are already two mega crew with better base ENG to fill those non-bonus faction seats. A zero for voyages/gauntlet and his arena EV activates after almost all instant damage crew have blown you to bits. His number was called for a recent mega event and may pop in a weekend or two down the line, but chasing obscure and volatile work should really only be an option if your other behold choices are equally useless or bland.

You can find something nice to say about every crew in the game. Almost every crew. Not a single stray event, no middling gauntlet pair, no shot at voyage work here. In fact, the Bynar pair sits outside the top ten super rare voyagers which is something that among legendary crew only one-skill Captain Scott can claim. The only remotely usable attribute this card has is +9 arena EV at six seconds (short duration). Fusing cards to create a legendary has long been requested and is a neat concept, but whether or not you think mashing up all those poor super rares to produce a legendary is worth it, in this case it is not. This is the worst legendary crew in the game.
