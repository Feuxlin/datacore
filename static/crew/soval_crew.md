Soval's bases aren't really good enough for daily use which leaves the Vulcan trait as his most likely chance to man a shuttle. If you're taking him in a behold it's almost always for his rare arena ability; EV available at one second. His DIP proficiency ranked near the top 10 is notable, but his skill set is the most competitive in the gauntlet and his chance of snagging wins there is slim.
