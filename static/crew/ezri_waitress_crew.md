The only number that pops is Dax's considerable event count. She receives a lot of praise from players, but I'm not seeing what they do. MED is useful early game and hers is best among Dax crew, but in a small amount, and her best gauntlet pair sits behind the stronger, more common Faith Garland and Doc Crusher.
