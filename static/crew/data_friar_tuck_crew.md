A top 20 voyager with loads of events. His bases aren't outstanding, but manage to avoid the ENG logjam from so many other 5* Datas and will perform nicely for SEC/DIP event shuttles instead. Take note of his expensive build cost including a fistful of Sec 31 items, but he will pay off the investment when finished.
