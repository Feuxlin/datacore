The man of a thousand primaries; Jules' voyage skills are distributed flatter than any crew in the game. His base primary (DIP) is variant-best and his voyage primary (MED) is the lowest of all MED primaries. But between an above average stat total and helpful MED/SEC combo, he has the tools to be a voyage player as well as picking up the occasional event work. Six second arena EV with great passive stats and three collections rounds him out well, even if he's not elite in any area.
