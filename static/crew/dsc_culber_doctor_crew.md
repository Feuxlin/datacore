In the case of Disco crew embodying power creep, Culber is Exhibit A. Assuming the competition doesn't have the formerly niche, pack-only Surgeon Pulaski, Culber is 15% better than the next best option. For a skill like MED which has a fraction of the options that other skills do, that's a big difference. And just for good measure, he's a great Disco option for SCI. The Discovery megas just don't stop coming and with them, Culber enjoys a huge jump in power as one of the most important crew in the game during those periods. While we don't give much credit to 2-skill voyagers (for good reason), he is the #1 voyage MED, #1 voyage SCI+MED total and the #2 voyage total among 2-skill crew. In an ideal world, he doesn't make too many voyages, but this is a game of opportunity and chances are that if you FF Culber for his exemplary event bases, he will shove off on a voyage or two considering the thin options for voyage medics.
