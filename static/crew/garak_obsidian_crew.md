Shockingly, there isn't more to this simple tailor than meets the eye. Average base, event count, and voyage numbers with a skill set that could be described the same. His best offering is a pair of variant-best bases. A couple SEC/DIP options have been added for voyages in 2018, but he still has a cult following on forums as a solid crew. Who am I to argue?
