An interesting crew. Disappointing voyage numbers, but as with other uncommon skill sets it matters less as only three crew with a better total have ENG+CMD as their top 2 skills. That under-represented skill set carries over to the gauntlet where his ENG/CMD pair can compete with the big boys and sits at #4 among all crew. A stat boosting collection and Neelix + Ferengi events round him out well.
