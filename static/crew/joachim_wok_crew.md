Joachim's previous Big Book note was made to look foolish yet again when another mega activated one of his traits, adding a chunk to his event count. A villain mega pushing him into double-digits wouldn't surprise me, but if we're spitballing like that then there are still loads of other crew who would be ahead of him in line. The ubiquity of SEC shuttle seating and the strength of his base make him a more attractive option than other "non-event" 2-skill crew, but it's advisable to invest in an equivalent SEC crew who's more flexible for voyages, arena, gauntlet, or has more reliable events. His other notable non-event offering is the SEC/Pilot node unlock.
