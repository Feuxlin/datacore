There are a handful of crew who provide the bulk of their contribution with a single star; 'gauntlet crew'. Their proficiency totals are huge, allowing them to dominate the gauntlet. That also means that their bases must be lower than other 5* crew to keep them in balance.

In many cases, spending four more beholds worth of stars to immortalize them is not worth it. The above tiers are for 5/5 crew so some gauntlet-only 5* may not be ranked particularly highly, but grabbing a single star for them is almost always worth more than 1/5 of another crew in the same tier.

Some examples of beholdable gauntlet crew who gain most of their value from the first star:
> Admiral Nechayev, Admiral Riker, Ambassador Troi, Chancellor Gowron, Changeling Founder, Dr. Richard Daystrom, Gangster Spock, Kai Opaka, Rogue Kai Winn, Seven of Nine, Sulan, Revolutionary Damar

These are not all bad crew; they simply benefit most from their first star. Some will be worth adding stars to for their strong skill set, voyage totals or event count. Others, like Gowron or Troi, have such poor bases in a common skill set that more than one star isn't advised unless the other behold choices are particularly poor.
