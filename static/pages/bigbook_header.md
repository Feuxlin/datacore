This page collates structured crew stats with insightful details from [u/Automaton_2000](https://reddit.com/user/Automaton_2000)'s Big Book. Content used with his permission, see the original document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vvl3wS1cY29ScQwWcTA6tJgcXvbdadY6vgPpn0swzbs/edit#).

Crew are grouped (alphabetically) into tiers based on a completely subjective opinion of their fully fused desirability in a vacuum (Stat strength, usefulness, rare/unique bonuses, event opportunity etc). If you think a crew deserves to be higher or lower, go with your gut. Everybody values differently all the components that make up crew.
