Newly upkept by [OhMy-StarsAndGarters](https://www.reddit.com/user/OhMy-StarsAndGarters). Feel free to contact me if you want to offer some constructive feedback on the updates to the book - I love talking crew as much as you do, I assure you.

This section is written mostly for players in the early to mid-game, transitioning from Super Rare being the rarity to being more like the norm, with Legendary crew becoming more achievable and taking more of the load. I’ll be putting more of an emphasis on crew that are all-around winners, who will snag you hefty event bonuses and provide longer-lasting benefits, rather than your monthly rotation of voyage contributors. 

Newer players still in the 0-4 month region will want to focus on crew called out for having easy builds and strong voyage stats. Fusing crew, especially those with rarer skill sets, is the best thing you can do when you start, since it gives you a strong foundation from which to build.

Those of you in the 4-10 month region will want to focus more on event count and collections, especially those that will boost stats in the long term. Build cost is obviously more of a concern since Super Rare crew see the revolving door quite often, especially with event considerations, but don’t be afraid of investing in crew that will do right by you.

Stat ranks are among super rare crew unless otherwise noted.
