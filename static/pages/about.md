## Welcome

A note about mission data for equipment sources: the source data was collected from a handful of volunteering accounts, but it's missing the details from certain end-of-episode missions (depending on the choices the respective user made). This currently only affects the "estimated chroniton cost" value for crew. These are the missions whose data we're missing:
* By Hook Or By Crook [E1-M14B]
* The Toss [E2-M19A]
* A New Recruit [E2-M19C]
* Smiles and Knives [E4-M14B]
* Thy Enemy's Secrets [E5-M18A]
* Garak's Gamble [E7-M13A]
* Proven Toxicity [E8-M14A]
* Bearing Up [E9-M4A]
