Fusing up 5* crew is as important as any other rarity of crew. The worst voyage crew at 5/5 can be as effective as the best crew at 3/5. Each star you add to a crew is worth more stat points than the previous one.

That means when deciding between a 1/5 and 0/5, you shouldn't feel tied to a bad card just because you have a copy, but the more stars they have, the more important it becomes to finish them.

There are only so many voyage/shuttle slots you can use at one time. If you want your 5* crew to outperform the 4/4s, they almost always need to be higher than 1/5.

Here's my general rule of thumb for beholds with existing stars, with an eye on maximizing voyages:

| If your crew is | When to consider other crew |
| :-------------: | --------------------------- |
| 1/5 | Let the star be an important tie-breaker, but any clearly better crew or a character you love |
| 2/5 | Crew with a significant stat lead (250+ voyage/base total) or crew with a high event count that fill a skill need |
| 3-4/5 | Crew from Tier 1-3 or those you intend to add citations to immediately |
| 5/5 | Grab another copy of elite cards if other choices are bad. Copies can help in voyages, shuttles, faction events and gauntlet |

If you're free to play or always in a crew slot crunch, try not to collect new 1/5s from beholds unless they're very strong cards or crew you intend to add citations to. With an ever-growing pool of cards, it's important to take the star when possible; it's much easier to get new cards in the future (every week, in fact).
