3-skill crew are simply more useful day-to-day. They have the advantage of skill set flexibility in shuttles and gauntlet while also being vastly superior voyagers.

There are far too many 2-skill crew whose stats may look good on paper, but if all they're used for is non-event shuttles, they become a drain on your crew slots. Shuttle difficulty will equalize at about a 2/3rd success rate until you’re running fused legendaries with strong bases. Super rare crew with strong bases may earn a lot of daily use, but usually just result in your non-event success rate normalizing at a higher difficulty.

The great equalizer is events where the difference between 2-skill and 3-skill is negligible. A 2-skill crew with common skills or no gauntlet work is far more tolerable when they'll get an event bonus every other month.

When looking at 2-skill crew, favor those that have a great gauntlet roll, are frequent event crew, or have a top-tier base stat to pick up some work in events with few bonus crew.
